# My_portfolio
This is my first official building portfolio project (landing page)  by Emmanuel Oluwatosin Akinwande (Software engineering student) 
Nature of project: This mobile app/web server will have the full functionality of a standard  To-do list app/website and it will provide API to clients. This could be a mobile app or web  browser. At the completion of this project, users will be able to do the following; 
▪ Create tasks, sub-tasks and add comments 
▪ Make to-do lists and notes 
▪ Add interactive features like videos, voice notes, images, GIFs and many more ▪ Add reminders on events 
▪ Set start and end-date to define task deadlines 
▪ Add time estimates to make teams accountable 
▪ Time tracking 
▪ Markdown support 
▪ Organize and filter your work within tasks 
▪ Power-Ups: Says thank you, track goals, offer ideas for improvement Programming languages too use: 
▪ C programming (backend) 
▪ Python (backend) 
▪ SQL (database) 
▪ Javascript (frontend) 
▪ HTML/CSS (frontend) 
IDE: 
▪ Git bash 
▪ Vscodes (IDE) 
▪ Command line terminal 
Framework/Tools: 
▪ Git: I will be using git as our version control system. This will help me to collaborate  with other developers. 
▪ Postgresql: I will be using this because it is a powerful database engine and it is free  and open source. 
▪ Heroku: I will be using this to deploy my project so that it can be live such that  anyone can access it on the web. 
▪ CI/CD pipelines: I will be using this tool for continuous integration and deployment.  This will help to perform any updates to our apps with ease. 
▪ Docker: This is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run,  update and manage containers, executable components that combine application 
source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run  that codes in any environment. And so I will be using docker for this project.
